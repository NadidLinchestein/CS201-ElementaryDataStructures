## **Course Content Overview**

### **1. Abstract Data Types (ADTs)**

- Delve into the concept of **Abstract Data Types**, which define operations independently of their implementation.
- Differentiate between **ADTs** and **Data Structures**, highlighting their interplay in software engineering.

### **2. Arrays**

- Master arrays as a linear, contiguous **Data Structure**.
- Implement multi-dimensional arrays and learn efficient memory management techniques in **C++**.

### **3. Stacks and Queues**

- Understand **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)** and **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** principles.
- Implement stacks and queues using **static arrays**, **dynamic arrays**, and **circular arrays**.
- Analyze their operational complexities and trade-offs in system-level programming.

### **4. Pointers and References in C++**

- Cultivate a deep understanding of **memory addressing** and **pointer arithmetic**.
- Master the utilization of **references** and **dereferencing** for robust and flexible programming.
- Explore the application of pointers in **dynamic memory management** and **interfacing with hardware**.

### **5. Dynamic Memory Allocation**

- Explore runtime memory allocation using **malloc**, **calloc**, and **new** operators in C++.
- Address challenges such as **fragmentation**, **memory leaks**, and **dangling pointers**, and implement strategies for their mitigation.
- Understand the importance of **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)** for efficient resource management.

### **6. Linked Data Structures**

- Implement **Linked Lists**, **Linked Stacks**, and **Linked Queues** using **node-based architectures**.
- Explore **singly linked lists**, **doubly linked lists**, and **circular linked lists** for flexible memory usage.
- Harness non-contiguous memory allocation to dynamically manage datasets of varying sizes.

### **7. Algorithm Efficiency**

- Evaluate algorithms using **asymptotic notations** such as **Big O**, **Big Theta (Θ)**, and **Big Omega (Ω)**.
- Conduct **time complexity** and **space complexity** analysis to optimize performance.
- Explore **amortized analysis** for understanding average-case behavior in dynamic systems.

### **8. Searching and Sorting Algorithms**

- Implement fundamental algorithms such as:
  - **Linear Search** and **Binary Search** for efficient data retrieval.
  - **Bubble Sort**, **Quick Sort**, **Merge Sort**, and **Heap Sort** for data organization.
- Conduct **best-case**, **worst-case**, and **average-case** performance analysis for these algorithms.

### **9. Advanced Data Structures: Hash Tables, Graphs, and Trees**

- Design **Hash Tables** with **open addressing** and **chaining** for collision resolution.
- Explore **Graphs**, including **directed**, **undirected**, and **weighted graphs**, and their representations using **adjacency matrices** and **adjacency lists**.
- Master **Trees** and specialized variants such as **Binary Trees**, **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)**, and **Balanced Trees** like **AVL** and **Red-Black Trees**.
- Learn advanced traversal algorithms like **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**.
